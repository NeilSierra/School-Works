        <ul type="square">
          <li>
            As an institution inspired by the philosophy “Veritas et Fortitudo”,
            we conscientiously seek to provide students with a body of language
            that will enable them to apply the knowledge and skills in the
            fields of Engineering and ICT;
          </li>
          <li>
            As a learning institution, we support the development and wellbeing
            of a competent, responsible and God-fearing individual through
            innovative, scientific, social, cultural and industry-based
            programs.
          </li>
          <li>
            As a member of a conscientious community, we support programs that
            will lead to the development of community awareness through student
            participation in various activities that will highlight the social
            impact of Engineering and ICT in the business environment.
